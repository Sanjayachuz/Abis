# ⭐ Next Step (Optional):  
I can **customize the README** to match your app’s exact features if you send me:

✔ A screenshot of your homepage  
✔ A small description of what the site does  
✔ Any technologies I should add/remove  

Want an even more polished README with images, badges, and GIF previews?
